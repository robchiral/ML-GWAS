This repository contains code and scripts used in our manuscript "Genetic analyses of eight complex diseases using predicted continuous representations of disease." We performed all analyses using Python 3.11.6 and RStudio 2023.12.1+402.

Data and notebooks needed to reproduce figures and tables, MR results, summary statistics, and PRS weights are available in the companion [Zenodo repository](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14969848).
